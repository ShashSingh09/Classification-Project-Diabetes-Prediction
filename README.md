### Objective:
The primary objective is to build and evaluate predictive models to identify early-stage diabetes based on the presented symptoms and patient characteristics.
### Data:
The dataset contains information on individuals, including their age, gender, and various symptoms associated with diabetes. These features will be utilized to train and evaluate the predictive models.
### Models used:
* Logistic Regression
* Gaussian Naive Bayes
* Decision Tree
### Evaluation:
The performance of each model is assessed using relevant evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
### Significance:
Early detection of diabetes is crucial for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. The developed models aim to assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of early-stage diabetes, enabling proactive healthcare management.
